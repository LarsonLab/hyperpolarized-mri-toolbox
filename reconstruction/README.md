# Reconstruction Methods for Hyperpolarized MRI

This folder contains tools supporting reconstruction of hyperpolarized data, both MRI as well as MRS and MRSI.

## Phase Correction

`find_phase_corr.m` attempts to estimate a zero-order phase correction to put all the signal into the real channel of complex-valued data

`phase_correct_image.m` performs voxel wise phase corrections across an image

## Coil Combination

This contains code for combining multi-coil data to improve SNR, including the "RefPeak" method for estimating coil sensitivities based on the data.

[Example of Usage in the EPI demo notebooks](../demo_notebooks/EPI%20Reconstruction%20Demo.ipynb)

## EPI and EPSI Demos

These demos were created to accompanying the reference below, and also include Jupyter notebook versions in `/demo Notebooks/`

[EPI demo notebooks](../demo_notebooks/EPI%20Reconstruction%20Demo.ipynb)

Note that the EPSI demo including the compressed sensing does not work due to missing functions.
