function [Sscale, Mzscale] = flips_scaling_factors(flips, Nt)
% flips_scaling_factors - compute magnetization scaling factors for each timepoint dataset from a
% series of RF pulses.  Useful for kinetic modeling, especially with complex flip angle strategies
% INPUTS
%   flips (radians) - [# of metabolites, # of excitations]
%       If excitation is different from Nt, then it is assumed that there are Nt/# of 
%	excitations that contribute to each resulting timepoint dataset
%   Nt - number of timepoints across which to calculate scaling
% OUTPUTS
%   Sscale - Signal scaling factors for correcting signals
%   Mzscale - Longitudinal magnetization scaling to account for in dynamics
