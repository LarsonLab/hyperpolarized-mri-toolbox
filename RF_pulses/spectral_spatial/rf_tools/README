  This directory contains all the rf_tools matlab stuff.  Put this in
your MATLABPATH environment variable

  setenv MATLABPATH /usr/local/wherever/rf_tools

if that is where you put it. 

  You need to compile the simulator, and various parts of the design
algorithm. These are the the "mexX" subdirectories, where X is 4 or 5
depending on whether you are using matlab 4 or 5.

  If you are using matlab 4, cd to mex4, do a "make all", and copy the
.mexsol files back into this directory.

  If you are using matlab 5, run matlab, and cd to the mex5 directory.
If you are using the default compiler on your platform, then invoke

  mex abrx.c
  mex b2rf.c
  mex b2a.c
  mex cabc2rf.c

Then quit matlab, and copy the mex5/*.mexsol files into the rf_tools
directory.  I use gcc under Solaris, in which case, use

  mex CC=gcc OPTFLAGS=-fPIC abrx.c

instead.  The -fPIC flag is important.  Without it, things seem to
work, but fail occasionally for no apparent reason.  Also, make sure
/usr/ccs/bin and the matlab5.1/bin directory are in your path, and
that you use the Sun make, as, and ld, and not the gnu version that
may be lurking elsewhere.

  There is documentation in man.ps, as well as online help for most
routines.

New features for this release are support throughout for 2D RF pulses
including design, simulation and plotting.  The routine dz2d designs
spiral 2D pulses. The spectral-spatial pulse design routine is new.
It does a true 2D SLR design, so it works fine for large flip angles.

Let me know if if find any bugs, would like things to work differently,
or have anything you like to see added.
