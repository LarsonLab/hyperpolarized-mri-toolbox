% Determines minimum-order minimum-phase filter that has a magnitude
% response that meets the magnitude amplitude/ripple specifications.  
% It will only return filters with an odd number of taps.
%
% function [h, status] = fir_minphase(n, f, a, d, use_max, dbg)
%
% Inputs: --- similar to cfirpm
%   n: max number of taps to try
%   f: frequency bands
%   a: amplitude at band edges
%   d: ripple  in bands
%   use_max: don't search for min order, use n taps
%   dbg: flag to turn on debugging statements/plots
%

% NOTE: why must spectral factorization accept odd number taps only?
% No chance to do even filters?
