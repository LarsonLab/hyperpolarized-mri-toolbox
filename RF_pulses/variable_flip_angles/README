These Matlab functions are for designing variable flip angle schemes for hyperpolarized MR applications.  All functions are documented within.  

Description of functions:
* vfa_const_amp
	RF-compensated variable flip angle scheme for constant signal
	Can also include compensation for T1 or an effective T1, aiming for constant signal amplitude

* vfa_opt_signal
	flip angle schemes to maximize the total signal when summed across all acquisitions
	Theoretically derived to include compensation for T1 decay
	Emperically derived to be optimal for metabolic products as well in optimal_SNR_demo.m

* mvfa_const_amp
	Constant amplitude signal flip angles in the presence of both T1 decay and metabolic conversion

* optimal_SNR_flips
	Optimization of total metabolic product signal when summed across all acquisitions
	Results are nearly identical to vfa_opt_signal, as demonstrated in optimal_SNR_demo.m
