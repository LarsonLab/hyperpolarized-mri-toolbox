======================

This package includes Matlab functions to design spectral-spatial RF pulses (also known as spatial-spectral RF pulses) for application to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging.  See the "examples/" folder for sample code and pulse designs.

Requirements:
- Signal Processing Toolbox (MathWorks)
- Optimization Toolbox (MathWorks)
- rf_tools package : This is included in the package, and also available for download at http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html
